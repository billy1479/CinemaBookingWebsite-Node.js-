# Cinema Booking website - Year 1 Coursework

This project was the coursework element of 'Programming Black', a first year module at Durham University for Computer Science students. 

It was a means to showcase the knowledge of Node.js, proper code formatting and code testing. It has an API in app.js and has tests for these in app.test.js. 

The server starts by running 'npm start' in the console. 

NOTE - Might be issues with CORS depending on machine so might need to be tweaked to allow this.
